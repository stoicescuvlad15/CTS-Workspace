In order to create an online game (with super-heroes), you need to create a software solution that will provide

1. Efficient management of the connection to the Database / logger
- the different modules must use or link a unique connection to the database
- programmers implementing those modules cannot build multiple objects associated with the database connection
- the client must use a unique object to take care of the connection to the database

2. The application will use different databases for development and production.
- The connections to those db's must be unique without the overhead of creating multiple singleton classes
