Code Review

1. Code structure & naming conventions:

	- The package name is too generic; Where is the module name?
	- The class name is not self-explanatory
	- The function name is too generic
	- The function arguments names are not meaningful
	
2. Implementation

	- Too many "magic numbers" (hard-coded values)
	- Is t limited to {1,2,3,4} or it can be bigger?
	- There are no validations for t, s and period
